## Part of a Learning Series

This starter is the companion project to a comprehensive blog series on Metalsmith development, available at [glinka.co](https://glinka.co/blog/). The series takes you from the very basics to advanced techniques in a progressive, step-by-step approach:

1. **Introduction to Metalsmith** - Why Metalsmith is still relevant in 2025
2. **Getting Started with Metalsmith** - Building your first simple site (using this starter!)
3. **Site Structure and Organization** - Best practices for project organization
4. **Enhancing Your Site with Plugins** - Adding functionality through the plugin ecosystem
5. **Advanced Templating with Nunjucks** - Creating flexible, reusable layouts
6. **Nunjucks in Markdown with M+N** - Component-based content authoring
7. **Structured Content with Sections** - Building complex, modular pages
8. **Advanced Metalsmith Features** - Custom plugins and optimization techniques

Each article in the series builds on the previous ones, allowing you to progressively enhance this starter project with new features and capabilities.

## Why Metalsmith?

Metalsmith stands out among static site generators for its simplicity and flexibility. It follows a straightforward approach:

1. Read files from a source directory
2. Transform them using plugins
3. Write the results to a destination directory

This minimalist philosophy gives you complete control over your build process without imposing rigid structures or complex architectures. Whether you're building a simple blog, a documentation site, or a sophisticated marketing platform, Metalsmith adapts to your needs rather than forcing you to adapt to it.

## Getting Started

To begin working with this starter:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to build the site
4. Run `npm run serve` to view the site locally

The project is intentionally kept simple to make it easy to understand and modify. Explore the code, make changes, and watch how Metalsmith transforms your content!
